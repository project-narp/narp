# Project NARP
## Built by: [Andrew Davis](https://andavi.github.io/), Peter Murphy, Richard Bellamy and Nikki Carthen

**Description**

Project Narp is an aid for students or users that wished to learn more about JavaScript. It was created with the intent to help reinforce JavaScript topics that you would use or come across while learning how to code. 

**Why Project NARP**

As a team, we realized a need for a site that made understanding concepts presented in JavaScript easier to understand. Sometimes when being taught certain concepts we realized the over use of technical language and wanted to devise a site that would break these topics down in an easier to understand style.
