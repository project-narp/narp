            <figcaption>I am currently studying web development at Code Fellows. Some of my greatest strengths are problem solving and attention to detail. As a Navy veteran and a computer science college graduate, I am looking to land a role as a software developer. I am hoping to work with a company where I can contribute value and continue to grow in my career.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>My name is Rick and my favorite food is sushi.  I'm new to coding but I'm interested in learning as much as I possibly can.  I'm especially interested in working on application, network, and data security and user testing.  In my off time I like to watch movies, play computer games and exercise.</figcaption>
