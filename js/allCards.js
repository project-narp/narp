  {
    title: 'Boolean',
    explanation: 'Booleans are like an on or off switch, with only two possibilities, true or false',
    example:
`3 > 7
// → false`,
    question: 'Which boolean does the following evaluate to?',

    solution: 'true',
    solved: false,

  },
  {
    title: 'Order of Operations',
    explanation: 'The logical operator || has the lowest precedence, followed by &&, then the comparison operators (>, ==, and so on), then the rest.',
    example:
`2 * 0 || true == false

    title: 'String concatenation',
    explanation: 'Strings can be concatenated by adding them together with the + operator.',
    example:
`'Se' + 'at' + 'tle' + ' ' + 'Sea' + 'ha' + 'wks'
// → "Seattle Seahawks"`,
    question: 'What does the following string concatenation evaluate to?',

  },
  {
    title: 'Template Literals',
    explanation: 'String literals use backticks (`) and allow you to pass in an expression to be evaluated inside the string. They also allow for multi line strings.',
    example:
`\`3 * 7 is \${3 * 7}\`
// → "3 * 7 is 21"`,
    question: 'What does the whole line evaluate to?',

   thisArray[5] = 8;
   //thisArray at index 5 gives you 8
   thisArray.length(); = 6;

    title: 'Fun with Functions',
    explanation: 'Functions declarations are like mini programs where you can write functionality into an enclosed code block, then execute it, or call it when you want to, until it\'s called it waits patiently, doing nothing.',
    example: `
var tired, playful, hungry;

  {
    title: 'Let',
    explanation: 'The <code>let</code> keyword is similar to <code>var</code> in that it signifies the start of a variable binding. The <code>let</code> binding is scoped to the statement block it is declared in, including if/else blocks and loop blocks, whereas the <code>var</code> binding is scoped to the function it is declared in.',
    example:
`let x = 1;
if (true) {
  let y = 2;
  var z = 3;
  console.log(x + y + z);
  // → 6
}
// y is not visible here

  },
  {
    title: 'Sort',
    explanation: 'The sort() method sorts the items of an array. The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric, and either ascending (up) or descending (down). By default, the sort() method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana"). However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1". Because of this, the sort() method will produce an incorrect result when sorting numbers.',
    example:
`var fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango'];
fruits.sort();
// → [ 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Mango', 'Orange' ]`,
    question: 'What does the following code log to the console?',
    problem:
`var arr = [10, -7, 0, -2, 5];
console.log(arr.sort()[0]);`,
    solution: '-2',
    solved: false,
    group: 3,
    reason: 'Since the sort method sorts numbers lexicographically, -2 comes before -7. The sorted array from above is <code>[ -2, -7, 0, 10, 5 ]</code>. The solution is to pass a comparison function into the sort method: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">Further Reading</a>'
  },
  {
    title: 'Ternary Conditional',
    explanation: 'This one is called the conditional operator (or sometimes just the ternary operator since it is the only such operator in the language). The value on the left of the question mark “picks” which of the other two values will come out. When it is true, it chooses the middle value, and when it is false, it chooses the value on the right.',
    example:
`console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
// → 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
// → 2`,
    question: 'What does the following code log to the console?',
    problem:
`var comparator = 13 % 4 === 1 ? '>' : '<';
console.log(\`javascript \${comparator} python\`);`,
    solution: 'javascript > python',
    solved: false,
    group: 1
  },
  {
    title: 'Recursion',
    explanation: 'A function that calls itself is called recursive.',
    example:
`function power(base, exponent) {
  if (exponent == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
  }
}

console.log(power(2, 3));
// → 8`,
    question: 'What does the following code return?',
    problem:
`function factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
factorial(6);`,
    solution: '720',
    solved: false,
    group: 2
  },{
    title: 'Function Declaration and Expression',
    explanation: 'besides from the syntax differences, the biggest difference between these two types of functions is that function declarations can be called above or below where it is defined, whereas function expressions behave like other variables and can only be called below the definition',
    example: `
var x = function(){
  console.log('x');  
  }
function y(){
  console.log('y');
  }
  x();
  y();
    `,
    question: 'will the following code run or result in an error, enter true if it will run, enter false if it will break',
    problem: `

    solution: 'false',

  {
    title: 'For Loop',
    explanation: 'A for loop is a type of loop that executes over  a given range and performs given actions over the course of that range.',
    example: `

  fibby(9);
    `,
    solution: '21',
    solved: false,
    group: 1,
    reason: 'the Fibonacci sequence"s first three iterations are 0,1,1. We hard coded those, and that"s why our for loop iterator begins at 3.  newMemory is current and oldMemory is 1 iteration older than it. Active adds both memories, oldMemory becomes newMemory and newMemory becomes active. In this the memories are constantly updating themselves, and active is growing the sum larger and larger.',
