    explanation: 'The logical operator || has the lowest precedence, followed by &&, then the comparison operators (>, ==, and so on), then the rest.',
    example: `
      2 * 0 || true == false <br>

    question: 'What does this evaluate to?',
    problem: '1 + 1 == 2 && 10 * 10 > 50',
    solution: 'true',
    solved: false
